<hr>
<p><h3>Roodeplaat Dam</h3></p>
<p>Roodeplaat Dam has the option of driving or walking, or a combination of both. With the dam and river, it is good for viewing water birds.  There are several hides as well.</p>
<p><h3>Marievale</h3></p>
<p>Marievale is a wetland area and a ramsar site.  There is always lots to see at any time of the year. Often large flocks of Flamingos feed there.</p>
<p><h3>Aloe Farm</h3></p>
<p> The Aloe Farm is best visited in late autumn or early winter when the aloes are in flower.  Birds that need the nectar congregate there at that time of the year as food is scarce every where else.</p>
